# Inheritance

## Object

Objects have two major components:

1. State
2. Behavior

States are nothing but properties or attributes. And behavior are nothing but methods.
These are fundamental parts of object oriented programming.
Classes are blueprints for creating objects.
Static methods are class specific and affect every object id changed by one object
Non static methods are object specific and only be called by objects
